## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this section I put into practice my basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, highlighting the use of the </img> and the use of variables for color styles.


```html
<section class="container">
    <img src="/images/image-qr-code.png" alt="Frontend Mentor QR">
    <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
    <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
  </section>
```
```css
:root {
    --color-white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --color-light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --color-grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --color-dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I will continue to use variables for styles and improve the use of them.
